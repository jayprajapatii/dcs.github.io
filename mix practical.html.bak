The North Gujarat University was carved out of Gujarat University whose Headquarter is at Ahmedabad. On bifurcation, the North Gujarat University inherited no physical assets from its parent University. It had, therefore, to start its existence ab-initio so far as its local habitation was concerned. PATAN, a historical town in northern part of Gujarat, was officially designated as the Head-Quarter town of the University. The town happens to have composite campus of four affiliated colleges. The managing council of the colleges was kind enough to put at the disposal of the infant University its two hostel buildings on rent to accommodate its offices. Thus began the University to operate and serve 41 colleges scattered over the three erstwhile districts of Banaskantha, Mehsana and Sabarkantha allotted in its jurisdiction. Along with the two hostel buildings the University rented a hall, called the Gandhi Memorial hall, to house its library. The aim was to start building up a nucleus library for the future post-graduate departments of the university.

This was an act of foresight of the first functionaries of the University. The University simultaneously moved the State Government to acquire land admeasuring about 185 acres from farmers. It also requested the State Government to transfer its seed farm land admeasuring about 35 acres to the University. However, this entailed considerable delay owing to litigation in the State High Court and then in the Supreme court. Following the supreme court judgment acquisition of the land has been possible. As a result over the years the university has been able to get land as follows. Government land 35.00 acres Land acquired from the farmers 177.50 acres.The university will in due course acquire land admeasuring 7.50 acres from one farmer. Total land available = 212.50 acres. In addition to this the University has also received a property worth Rs.10/- lakhs by way of donation from the Gramodhyog Mandal, Patan. At present the University Employment Bureau is housed in that building. Our proposals to the State Government for further assistance in materializing plans for more constructions in phased manner, are under active consideration.
